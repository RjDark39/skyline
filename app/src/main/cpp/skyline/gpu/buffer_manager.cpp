         * 1.1) If they match as well, we return a view encompassing the entire buffer
         * 2) Only a contiguous range of mappings match, we check for the overlap bounds, it can go two ways:
         * 2.1) If the supplied buffer is smaller than the matching buffer, we return a view encompassing the mappings into the buffer
         * 2.2) If the matching buffer is smaller than the supplied buffer, we make the matching buffer larger and return it
         * 3) If there's another overlap we go back to (1) with it else we go to (4)
         * 4) Create a new buffer and insert it in the map then return it
